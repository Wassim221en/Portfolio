  üöÄ How to Properly Handle Refresh Tokens in Modern SaaS Applications
  When building authentication flows with JWT in multi-tenant SaaS systems, access tokens alone are not enough. Since access tokens usually have a short lifetime (e.g., 15 minutes), we need a secure way to keep users logged in without asking them to re-authenticate all the time.
üëâ That‚Äôs where refresh tokens come in.

üß† What is a Refresh Token?

A refresh token is a long-lived credential issued alongside the access token. It allows the client to request new access tokens without asking the user to log in again. Typically, refresh tokens live for weeks or months.

üõ°Ô∏è Secure Storage: Hash, Don‚Äôt Store Plain Text

Never store refresh tokens as plain text in your database.
Instead:

Generate a cryptographically secure random string (e.g., 32 bytes).

Store only its hash (e.g., SHA-256) in the database.

Return the plain token to the client only once.

This way, even if the database is leaked, attackers can‚Äôt reuse stolen refresh tokens.

üîÑ Rotation: The Modern Standard

In professional SaaS systems, rotating refresh tokens is a must:

User logs in ‚Üí Receives AccessToken + RefreshToken (R1).

Later, the client uses R1 to refresh ‚Üí Server issues R2 and invalidates R1.

Any reuse of R1 afterwards is detected and treated as suspicious.

This rotation flow significantly reduces the risk of replay attacks and allows for better session control across devices.

üß± Data Model Example

A typical RefreshToken entity might include:

UserId ‚Üí Link to the user

TokenHash ‚Üí Securely stored hash

ExpiresAt ‚Üí Token lifetime

IsUsed & IsRevoked ‚Üí Track usage & revocation

DeviceId, IpAddress ‚Üí Optional, for multi-device sessions and auditing

This gives you fine-grained control to revoke tokens per device, detect suspicious activity, and maintain a clear session history.

üß† Key Takeaways

‚úÖ Always hash refresh tokens before storing them.

üîÑ Implement token rotation for better security.

üìÖ Set reasonable expiration periods (e.g., 30‚Äì90 days).

üåê Track device/IP for multi-device SaaS scenarios.

üö® Detect and handle token reuse to prevent replay attacks.

Authentication is often overlooked, but refresh tokens are the backbone of secure, scalable session management in modern SaaS systems. If you get this part right early on, you‚Äôll avoid a lot of pain later. üîê

Would you like me to make it sound a bit more personal / thought-leader style (like ‚ÄúI learned this building a real SaaS‚Äù)? üß†‚ú®
